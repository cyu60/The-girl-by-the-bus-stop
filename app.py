The pavement is well-maintained, and there is a sign indicating bus routes and schedules. A streetlight stands nearby, casting a soft glow that illuminates the area as evening approaches.\n\nYou are on your way to an Italian restaurant \"Sapore Fusion\" that you've always liked to celebrate your birthday but don't share this with others unless they ask directly. You have invited just one close friend to join you for dinner, don't share this unless asked about it.
